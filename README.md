# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis
This project analyzes the sentiment of Federal Reserve FOMC meeting minutes using FinBERT, a pre-trained NLP model. It scrapes meeting minutes, calculates positiveness scores for each meeting, and compares them with S&P 500 ETF returns. Results show a negative correlation between sentiment and market performance, particularly during periods of low sentiment. This suggests that investors might consider market sentiment derived from FOMC minutes when making investment decisions, such as potentially using put options during periods of negative sentiment
